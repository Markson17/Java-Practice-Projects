# Java Practice Project

This Java Practice Project is a collection of basic Java tasks that I have personally coded to solidify my understanding of fundamental programming concepts. It includes a variety of simple programs such as a CGPA calculator, compound interest calculator, Fibonacci sequence generator, finding the maximum number, an odd-even number checker, quadratic root finder, recursive factorial calculator, simple interest calculator, and standard deviation calculator.

## CGPA Calculator

The CGPA Calculator is a simple program I have implemented that computes the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on the provided grades and credit hours for each course.

## Compound Interest Calculator

The Compound Interest Calculator is a program I have created that calculates the final amount of an investment based on the principal amount, interest rate, and the number of compounding periods.

## Fibonacci Sequence Generator

The Fibonacci Sequence Generator is a program I have developed that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-defined number of terms using both iterative and recursive approaches.

## Maximum Number Finder

The Maximum Number Finder program is my implementation for finding the maximum number from a given set of numbers entered by the user.

## Odd-Even Number Checker

The Odd-Even Number Checker program is my creation that checks whether a given number is odd or even and displays the result accordingly.

## Quadratic Root Finder

The Quadratic Root Finder program is my implementation that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

## Recursive Factorial Calculator

The Recursive Factorial Calculator is my solution for calculating the factorial of a given number using a recursive approach.

## Simple Interest Calculator

The Simple Interest Calculator is a program I have coded that calculates the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Standard Deviation Calculator

The Standard Deviation Calculator is my implementation that computes the standard deviation of a set of numbers entered by the user.

Feel free to explore these programs to understand my approach and coding style. You can modify and enhance the code as per your requirements and experiment with different approaches and functionalities.

### Running the Programs

To run the programs, you can compile the Java files using any standard Java compiler and execute the generated class files.

### Additional Notes

This project is meant for educational purposes to demonstrate my Java programming skills and understanding of basic programming concepts.
